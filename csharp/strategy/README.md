# Strategy Pattern.

Strategy pattern define the family of algorithims, enacapsulated each one and make them interchangable. They act as same time. Strategy let's the algorithim vary depending upon the client using it.
Example, if we have list data-structure created, and it has sort() implemented. Then the implementation of sort() can be using different strategies, e.g., insertion sort, merge sort, etc..
